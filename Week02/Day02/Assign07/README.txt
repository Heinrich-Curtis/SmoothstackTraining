The two programs here display two vastly different ways to compute a fibonacci
series and populate an array with the values. Both of them compile and run, but
the recursive one takes several minutes to complete, so please do not actually
run that program unless you need to go eat lunch or something. Each souce file 
has additional details on the method used in the program.
