Program that illustrates lots of concepts related to inheritance: polymorphic
classes, virtual and delegating functions, ets. Used to create a bunch of 
(admittedly incomplete) shape classes.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
navigate to directory, run make, run executable to see output of tests

STATUS
----------------------------------
Complete.Valgrind reports not memory issues or leaks.

ISSUES
----------------------------------
Had an issue figuring out accessing some private members in super classes
I wound up reading about online. Otherwise no issues, just a lot of grinding
